                            Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal (TAAN) is an umbrella association of trekking
                            agencies in the country. It was established in 1979 by a handful of trekking agency
                            operators who felt it was time to devise sound business principles as well as regulate
                            the
                            sector which was growing by leaps and bounds with every passing year. They also felt the
                            need of a strong lobby group that could suggest to the government on several issues to
                            promote the Nepali tourism industry and develop tourism as a revenue generating
                            industry.
                        </p>
                        <h5>
                            Initially, TAAN had limited its membership only to Nepalese trekking agencies. It later
                            opened associate membership to foreign organizations to broaden the scope of the
                            association.
                        </h5>

                            problems related to the trekking sector. The executive committee, which is elected every
